# Spring Boot and OAuth2

- the steps to create a sample app have Oauth wot spring :

- I will use react js not jQuery as front end because I don't know jQuery and react is better.

1. simple: a very basic static home page with unconditional login via Spring Boot OAuth .

2. click: add an clickable link that make user click to login.

3. logout: add a logout link to logout via Spring Boot .

4. two-providers: adds a second login provider so the user can choose on the home page which one to use.

5. custom-error: adds an error message for unauthenticated users (for those who not logging in ).

- the rest of the reading talk about  how to setup the code and start with a single-page app and link it with GitHub

- Authentication using an external OAuth 2.0 provider is a common thread running across all of the demos.
