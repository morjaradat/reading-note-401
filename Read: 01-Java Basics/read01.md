# Java Basics

## Variables

- basic data types (primitive types, character strings, and arrays)

- The Java programming language defines the following kinds of variables:

1. Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields)
2. Class Variables (Static Fields)
3. Local Variables
4. Parameters

- Variable names are case-sensitive.
- Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters
- If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters.

## Operators

- there is many operators like `multiplicative(* / %),additive(+ -),shift(<< >> >>>),relational(< > <= >= instanceof),equality(== !=)

## Expressions, Statements, and Blocks

- Operators may be used in building expressions

### Expressions

- An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value.

### Statements

- Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution.

### Blocks

- A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.

## Control Flow Statements

- The statements inside your source files are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear.
- Control flow statements, however, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.

# The first response in this Reddit thread on compiling

- the link is doesn't work

# XKCD: Compiling

- I have no idea what is that here

# Reading Java Documentation

- I read how to search in the index and what its mean
