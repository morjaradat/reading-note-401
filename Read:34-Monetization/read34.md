# Choose a monetization model for your app

## Sell goods or services through your app

* there are two primary ways you can accept payments :

1. Google Play's billing system
2. Google Pay

***Sell digital goods or services with Google Play's billing system***

* Items that require developers to use Google Play's billing system include the following:

1. Virtual game products, such as coins, gems, extra lives or turns, special items or equipment, characters or avatars, additional levels or playtime.
2. App functionality or content, such as an ad-free version of an app or new features not available in the free version.

4. Cloud software products, including data storage services, business productivity software, and financial management software.

***Sell physical goods or services with Google Pay***

* Use Google Pay to sell physical goods or services that are used or delivered outside of your app.

* Products where we recommend developers use Google Pay include the following:

1. Retail merchandise, such as groceries, clothing, housewares, and electronics.
2. Physical services, including taxi and transportation services, cleaning services, food delivery, airfare, and event tickets.
3. One-time membership fees or recurring dues, including gym memberships, loyalty programs, or clubs offering accessories, clothing, or other physical products.

## Other app monetization options

***Advertising***

* Get paid for showing Google AdMob ads, including native ads that allow you to match ads to your app's look and feel.

***Paid apps***

* Set a price for your app that the user must pay before they can download and install it. You can also take advantage of automatic local pricing (or set prices yourself), promo codes, and pricing templates.

## Best practices for setting your initial monetization strategy

1. Research other apps in your category
2. Think about how your app will be used
3. Make use of natural extensions
4. Consider your cost structures
5. Consider your audience
6. Consider local factors when setting prices

## Best practices for optimizing your monetization strategy

1. Analyze statistics in the Google Play Console: Gain an understanding of your users' purchasing patterns, including statistics on average revenue per paying user and new versus returning buyers.
2. Understand purchasing behavior with Google Analytics for Firebase: With data on up to 500 in-app events, Google Analytics for Firebase can provide insights into user buying behavior.
3. Run pricing experiments: Use in-app A/B testing to experiment with different prices and alternative ways to encourage users to take up subscriptions or purchase in-app products.
4. Offer a sale price: Paid apps can use strikethrough pricing in the Play Console to offer a discounted price for a limited time and encourage more purchases.
